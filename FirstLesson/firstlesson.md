Before work in a Raspberry Pi let's start programing in Python, why?
That's because If now we learn the basics of Python then the transition will be super easy

The first thing that we have to know is that in Python and programing we will use types of data
In the next table you will find the most popular and common data type 

| Data | Examples |
|------|----------|
|Integers|1,2,10,13|
|Float|1.1,2.2,3.1416|
|String|I'm a string|
|Bolean|True or false (1 or 0)|

Now that we know these kind of data we can start to work
Let's star creating our first program the easiest program

To do that we could create a directory wherever you want, it coulb be in your Desktop, in your files, choose a place where you can find it
In my case in going to create it in this respository 

To do that you have to open your favorite Code Editor and create a new file, but here is a **important** point.
When you are gooing to create a file that contain code inside you have to especify the extension, that depends in which lenguaje are you working.
In our case the extension will be **".py"** That refers to Python

| Extension | Kind of Lenguajes |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Python | .pyy |
| C++ | .cpp |
| JavaScrip | .js |
| HTML **It's not a Programing Lenguaje** | .html |
| Java | .java |
| Octave | .m |
| VHDL | .vhdl |

Let's continue, In my case I will name my file as "HelloWorld.py"
Inside of this program I will write the next:

```sh
print("Hello World, Let's begin a new adventure ")
```
Now maybe you have many question, What are you doing with this and probably, what does it do? 
To check what this program do, you have to go to your bash and move to the directory where is your file

Now you have to type 
```sh
python3 "theNameOfYourFile"
```
In this case will be:

```sh
python3 HelloWorld.py
```

Now you will see the a message print on your bash, more especific the "Hello World, Let's begin a new adventure"
Congratulations you already create your first program, the best it's comming
